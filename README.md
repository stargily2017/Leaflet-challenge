Description:
. The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data.
. TO collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it
. Use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.

Tools:
| Use HTML,CSS, Javascript, D3.js, geojson format, functions(mapColor, mapRadius, mapStyle)

Outline:

| Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
| Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
| Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
| Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
